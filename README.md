### Adding New Features

1. **New Anomaly Types**: Extend the `AnomalyDetection` interface in `types/index.ts`
2. **Additional Metrics**: Add new metric cards in the dashboard components
3. **3D Enhancements**: Modify the NetworkVisualization component for new visual features
4. **Data Sources**: Integrate real network data by replacing the data generator

### Testing & Quality Assurance

#### Build Validation
```bash
# Full type checking
npm run type-check

# ESLint validation
npm run lint

# Production build test
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

#### Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full type safety with strict compiler options
- **ESLint Rules**: Comprehensive linting with React and TypeScript rules
- **Import Optimization**: Tree-shaking friendly imports for better performance
- **Component Testing**: Manual testing across all dashboard features

#### Recent Quality Improvements
- ✅ **Zero TypeScript Errors**: All type issues resolved for production deployment
- ✅ **Zero ESLint Warnings**: Complete code quality compliance
- ✅ **Optimized Imports**: Removed unused imports for better bundle size
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Replaced all `any` types with proper TypeScript types
- ✅ **JSX Compliance**: Fixed all JSX parsing errors for proper rendering

## 🚀 Deployment

### ✅ Current Deployment Status

**Live Production Environment**: [https://flow-anomaly-detection.vercel.app](https://flow-anomaly-detection.vercel.app)

- **Platform**: Vercel
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed and operational
- **Build**: Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub integration
- **Performance**: Optimized for global CDN delivery
- **SSL**: Automatic HTTPS with Vercel's edge network
- **TypeScript**: Full compilation and type checking in build process
- **ESLint**: Code quality validation during deployment

### Recent Build Improvements

#### TypeScript/ESLint Error Resolution ✅
During phases 3-4 development, comprehensive fixes were applied to ensure successful Vercel deployment:

- **Unused Imports**: Removed unused UI components, icons, and chart libraries
- **Type Safety**: Replaced `any` types with proper TypeScript types
- **JSX Parsing**: Fixed JSX parsing errors with proper character escaping
- **Unused Variables**: Cleaned up unused variables and function parameters
- **Import Management**: Optimized import statements for better tree-shaking

#### Build Process Optimization
- **Compilation Time**: Reduced from 30+ seconds to ~24 seconds
- **Type Checking**: Zero TypeScript errors in production build
- **Linting**: All ESLint rules passing with zero warnings
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized component imports for smaller bundle sizes

### Vercel Deployment (Current Setup)

The application is currently deployed on Vercel with the following configuration:

1. **Automatic Deployments**: Every push to the `master` branch triggers a new deployment
2. **Build Configuration**: Next.js 15.3.3 with TypeScript compilation
3. **Environment**: Production-optimized build with performance monitoring
4. **Domain**: Custom domain with automatic SSL certificate

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. **Configure Build**: Vercel automatically detects Next.js configuration
3. **Deploy**: Automatic deployments on every push to main branch

### Docker Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Environment-Specific Builds

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production
npm run build && npm start

# Static export (if needed)
npm run build && npm run export
```
